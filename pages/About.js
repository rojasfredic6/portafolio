            <h5 class="bg-blue-vue rounded text-white m-2 p-2"> Front End Developer / Agro-industrial Engineer / Pastry Chef </h5> 
            <p class="font-light text-justify m-3 p-3" style="color: rgba(13, 97, 119, 1)"> Born and raised in Tauramena - Casanare, a small town at the foot of the eastern mountain range, who at his early school age showed fascination for computer technologies. My first approach to programming was with the LOGO program; That little "turtle" captivated me, the process of entering data, that the computer listened to them and that the turtle executed, seemed like magic.<br><br>

            Over time, I continued learning with basic tools, I won some fingering awards, I learned HTML by giving styles without CSS 3 (totally unaware of its existence), when I finished college I got the best student in Computer Technology. Despite what seemed obvious, I finished high school and did not apply for a career in programming. I finished studying Agroindustrial Engineering, where I learned a lot and was comfortable with topics such as Thermodynamics, Balance of Matter and Energy, Unitary Processes; However, the desire to learn programming was always in me, so while I was studying my undergraduate degree, looking for tutorials, I found Codecamy (which was originally in Spanish), with which I learned to reinforce HTML, CSS3, basic Js and JQuery.<br><br>
            
            Even with what he learned, he did not know how to prosecute him or what direction to give him, so he again put aside the idea of ​​programming. I got some jobs as an Agroindustrial Engineer but I always wanted to solve problems or situations, not as such, but as a programmer, but I didn't have enough tools to achieve it and I ended up bored and frustrated in my work. Until 2019, make the decision to enter Platzi, an online academy to learn programming tools and languages. A year later I was invited to join a special program called Platzi Master, where with the help of personalized tutors and a huge community, I can focus my path to becoming a Front End Developer. I have learned topics such as terminal and command line management, web accessibility, design for programmers, Js engine V8, Clousures and Scopes, Asynchronism, NPM package management, SPA with Js Vanilla, Webpack, Vue.js (My favorite <3 ), Vuex, Firebase, etc. With this I have managed to create my first web application, a page for taking orders for a bakery, which has filled me with great pride, and I hope to continue doing what for me is the job of my dreams: to be a programmer.<br><br>
            
            In the future I hope to learn about Back End, a world that I have not entered and hope to master, with the help of Node.js, Mongo DB and MySQL.</p>
